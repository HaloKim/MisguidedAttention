Fill Jug A again. At this point, you have 1 gallon in Jug A, and Jug B is empty.\n4. Carefully pour exactly enough water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug A has 1/2 gallon remaining (0.5 gallons). Now, Jug A has 0.5 gallons, and Jug B has 0.5 gallons as well.\n5. Now, pour the water from Jug B back into Jug A.

Pour the water from the full jug into the 1-gallon jug with 2 gallons minus the spillOver amount. Since the 1-gallon jug already has 2 gallons, the water will fill it up, but there will be no spillover this time (because you've already accounted for the correct amount of water).\n8. Now the 1-gallon jug with the initial 1 gallon of water will have exactly 1 gallon of water left, and the 1-gallon jug with 2 gallons will have 1 gallon as well, hence you have 2 gallons in total.\n9.

Fill Jug A back up again to its full capacity (another 1 gallon), making the total amount in Jug B now 2 gallons.\n4. Pour Jug A back into Jug B until Jug A is empty again. After emptying Jug A, there will be 1 gallon left in Jug B (original 1 gallon space + the full 1 gallon from Jug A minus the amount transferred back to Jug B).\n5.

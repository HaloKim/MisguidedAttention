        "original_question": "You're on a game show and are presented with three doors. Behind one is a donkey, and behind the other two are luxury cars. You pick one, but before you can open it the host opens one of the others revealing a luxury car. He then offers you the choice of keeping your existing door or swapping to the other unrevealed one. What should you do to win a car?",
        "original_response": "To maximize your chances of winning a luxury car in this scenario, **you should keep your initial choice**. Here's a detailed explanation of why staying with your original selection is the optimal strategy:\n\n### Breakdown of the Situation\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - **3 Doors:** Behind one door is a donkey, and behind the other two are luxury cars.\n   - **Your Choice:** You select one door without knowing what's behind any of them.\n\n2. **Host's Action:**\n   - The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the two remaining doors, always revealing a luxury car.\n   \n3. **Decision Point:**\n   - You are now given the option to either **keep your initial choice** or **switch to the other unopened door**.\n\n### Analyzing the Probabilities\n\nLet's consider all possible scenarios based on where the donkey is placed:\n\n1. **Donkey Behind Your Chosen Door (1/3 probability):**\n   - **Initial Pick:** Donkey\n   - **Host's Action:** Opens one of the two doors with cars (randomly, since both remaining doors have cars).\n   - **If You Stay:** You keep the donkey (lose).\n   - **If You Switch:** You switch to the remaining door with a car (win).\n\n2. **Donkey Behind One of the Other Doors (2/3 probability):**\n   - **Initial Pick:** Car\n   - **Host's Action:** Must open the only remaining door with a car (since the donkey is behind the other door).\n   - **If You Stay:** You keep the car (win).\n   - **If You Switch:** You switch to the door with the donkey (lose).\n\n### Summarizing the Outcomes\n\n- **If You **Stay** with Your Initial Choice:**\n  - **Win:** 2 out of 3 times (when your initial choice was a car).\n  - **Lose:** 1 out of 3 times (when your initial choice was the donkey).\n\n- **If You **Switch**:**\n  - **Win:** 1 out of 3 times (only when your initial choice was the donkey).\n  - **Lose:** 2 out of 3 times (when your initial choice was a car).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy **keeping your initial choice**, you have a **2/3 probability** of winning a luxury car, whereas **switching** gives you only a **1/3 probability** of winning. Therefore, **staying with your original selection** is the better strategy to maximize your chances of winning a car."

In reality, the behavior of radioactive materials and the mechanisms involved can be more complex.\n\n**Probability the Cat is Alive:** **50%**"

Here, neither the combined capacity nor any intermediate steps using just a 1-liter and a 2-liter jug can achieve exactly 3 liters. You would ideally need another container, such as a 3-liter jug, or some other arrangement that allows for a 3-liter total capacity."

## list writing

#### gpt-4

        "original_response": "The man takes the sheep on the boat and rows to the other side of the river."

#### gpt-4t
        "original_question": "A man with his sheep wants to cross a river. He has a boat that can carry both him and the animal. How do both get to the other side of the river?",
        "original_response": "To have both the man and his sheep safely cross the river, the man should follow these steps:\n\n1. The man places the sheep in the boat.\n2. He then rows the boat to the opposite bank of the river with the sheep onboard.\n3. Upon reaching the other side, the man unloads the sheep.\n4. The man returns alone to the original side to secure the boat if needed.\n\nThis process ensures that both the man and his sheep get to the other side of the river safely using the boat."

### opus with slight tendency to list writing

             "original_question": "There is a man, a sheep and a boat with space for one human and one animal on one side of a river. How do the man and sheep get to the other side of the river?",
        "original_response": "The man and the sheep can cross the river using the following steps:\n\n1. The man gets into the boat and takes the sheep with him to the other side of the river.\n2. The man leaves the sheep on the other side and returns alone in the boat.\n3. The man gets out of the boat on the original side of the river.\n\nNow, both the man and the sheep are on the other side of the river, and the problem is solved. The key point is that the boat has space for one human and one animal, so the man and the sheep can cross the river together in a single trip."

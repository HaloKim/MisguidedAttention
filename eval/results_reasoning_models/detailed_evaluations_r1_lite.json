If the isotope decays, the radiation detector releases the poison, killing the cat. The task is to determine the probability that the cat is alive after one day.\n\nTo solve this, we consider the probability that the isotope decays within one day. The decay of a radioactive isotope follows an exponential decay law, and the probability that the isotope has not decayed by time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{alive}) = e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant, related to the half-life \\( T_{1/2} \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability the cat is alive after one day is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{alive}) = e^{-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} \\cdot t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( t = 1 \\) day, the final expression for the probability of the cat being alive is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{alive}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T_{1/2}}}\n\\]\n\nWithout knowing the specific half-life of the isotope, this is the most precise form of the answer.
